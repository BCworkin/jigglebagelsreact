# My project for JiggleBagels 
Basically a react front-end project that will be used for a business startup for a friend of mine that runs a bagel business.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
